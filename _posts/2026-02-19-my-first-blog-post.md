Today I published my first blog post using GitHub Pages.

I’ve been learning how GitHub works — including branches, commits, pull requests, and merges. It feels good to finally understand the workflow.

This is just the beginning, but I’m excited to keep building and improving every day.

Stay tuned for more updates!
